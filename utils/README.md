# Utility code and tooling

While much of the code generated by this project functions by itself, it's not uncommon for the same problem to present itself more than once while dealing with multiple similar questions around multiple similar datasets. As such, it makes sense to have a home for any useful functions or snippets of code that might be handy for people facing the same challenges as you in the future.

Please document any file you add to this folder, both by commenting your code effectively and by adding a blurb to this readme about what your tool does -- what it wants as inputs, what it provides as outputs, and a little flavor about how it gets there in between.
