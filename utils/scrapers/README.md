# Data scrapers

Part of the challenge of this project is the lack of publicly available data sources on the number of juvenile offenders with multiple offenses. This folder contains data scrapers designed to attack that issue, pulling crime data from relevant public sources to try and help us identify how changes in the law can help people improve their lives.

Data collected by these scrapers should live in [the raw data folder](/data/raw). Please note that if your data is sensitive (i.e., can be tied to an individual), we do not want it in this repo. Please save it as a .csv (so it'll be blocked by our .gitignore) and contact a collaborator to figure out a solution for data storage moving forward.
