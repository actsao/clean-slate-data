Following the meanings of the digits in an incident code, the category code representing this criteria would be '11.1'. The first digit is one because it must be a juvenile incident; the second digit is 1 because it must be a 100J eligible incident; the third digit is a period because the critera does not make any demands regarding sex/murder offenses; the fourth digit is 1 because there must be a guilty disposition.\n",

However, the approach is also complex enough to be prone to errors. As part of the testing to ensure the accuracy of the above method, the three questions provided by CfJJ are answered here using a different method not involving incident codes or regex pattern matching. The approach below is less flexible and efficient, but more straightforward to debug for accuracy.\n",
